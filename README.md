# Web-Scraping-of-Earthquake-data

We will use python to query data from web and access data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov(Links to an external site.). This portal 
has a public API that can be used to access data for all seismic events for a given duration of time. For example the 
following url can be used to fetch data from 2016-10-01 to 2016-10-02

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2016-10-01&endtime=2016-10-02
